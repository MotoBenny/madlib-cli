### Description

Create a file called madlib.py at root of madlib_cli folder, which will contain all of the \
Python code that you will write relating to your Madlib game. \
Keeping in mind the concept of Single Responsibility Principle, \
build a command line tool which will perform the following: \
Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions \
Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts. \
Prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components \
of the Madlib template.
With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each \
provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.
After the resulting Madlib \
has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line. \
Write the completed text (Example)to a new file on your file system (in the repo). \
Note: A smaller example file is included as well which can be handy when developing/testing.
